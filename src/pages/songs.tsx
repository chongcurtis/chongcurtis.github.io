                If you love any of these songs as much as I do I want to be friends with you! These
                songs have the I'm combination of lyrics + instrumentals, and I hope you find
                something new!

                    <span className="font-bold">Begin Again:</span> This music video was what got me
                    into her music. It's just so elegant and aesthetic. "But on a Wednesday in a
                    Cafe, I watched it begin again" - This line is just so hopeful and makes me
                    smile every time.

                    <span className="font-bold">Fearless:</span> My favourite song from the Fearless
                    album. I loved it so much that I made it my morning alarm... I then promptly
                    changed my alarm

                    One of my favourite nights during covid was playing a recording of her Immunity
                    concert on the projector and singing along as if I was there.

                <div>
                    <span className="font-bold">Bags:</span> My favourite song of all time. The part
                    where her voice syncs up with the base in: "Savor this with everything I have
                    inside of me" is incredible. The entire song is also just so relatable:
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Can you see me I'm waiting for the right time.
                    <br />
                    I can't read you but if you want the pleasure's all mine.
                    <br />
                    Can you see me using everything to hold back?
                    <br />I guess this could be worse, walking out the door with your bags.
