                    Begin Again: This music video was what got me into her music. It's just so
                    elegant and aesthetic. "But on a Wednesday in a Cafe, I watched it begin again"
                    - this line is just so hopeful and makes me smile every time.

                <div>Ours: Possibly my favourite taylor swift song. Ever. It's just so sweet</div>
                <div>
                    Fearless: My favourite song from the Fearless album. I loved it so much that I
                    made it my morning alarm... I then promptly changed my alarm

                    One of my favourite nights during covid was playing a recording of her Immunity
                    concert on the projector and singing along as if I was there.

                <div>
                    Bags: My favourite song of all time. The part where her voice syncs up with the
                    base in: "Savor this with everything I have inside of me" is incredible. The
                    entire song is also just so relatable: "Can you see me I'm waiting for the right
                    time. I can't read you but if you want the pleasure's mine"
                </div>
