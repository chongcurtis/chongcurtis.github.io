                Have you read Zero to One? Do you listen to All-in? Have you read the Three Body
                Problem? Unforunately, I have to answer yes to all three.

            <p>Here are my favourite books:</p>
            <div>
                <p>The Alchemy of Air</p>
                <p>
                    This book changed my life because it taught me that humanity has solved
                    calamity-scale problems before: Running out of food. It's about how a scientist
                    and an engineer spent years bringing down the cost of man-made fertilizer to
                    replace the world's limitted supply of natural fertilizer, feeding half the
                    world population. It made me much more optimistic about climate change. It was
                    really fascinating because these people solved the world's biggest problem and
                    nobody knows about it.
